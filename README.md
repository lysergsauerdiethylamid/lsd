Just a collection of different ideas, as well as the path of my learning in coding. If you want to give advice or help in development, I will only be glad.

Hello everyone, I'm an ordinary person from Russia who wants to introduce myself to programming.
I am 23, but I have not been interested in programming before. There was no time, and I am lazy by myself.
That's it.
