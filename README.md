Just a collection of different ideas, as well as the path of my learning in coding. If you want to give advice or help in development, I will only be glad.

Hello everyone, I'm an ordinary person from Russia who wants to introduce myself to programming.
I am 23, but I have not been interested in programming before. There was no time, and I am lazy by myself.
That's it.

My plan of action and what it is all about:
I will be learning some programming languages (C #, Java, Python) but start with Java first. Then I will move on to python and only then I will learn C #.
As I progress in knowledge and training, I will create programs or something useful (most likely a bicycle, but suddenly an idea appears).
